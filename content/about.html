<p>Iâ€™m an aspiring Software/Machine Learning Engineer interested in nearly everything Tech-related, currently studying towards an MSc in Machine Learning &amp; Data Science at Imperial College London.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re working on an interesting problem in this space and are looking for help, it would be great to hear from you!</p>
<p>Previously, I received an MEng in Engineering Science from Oxford University and spent the 7+ years after graduating in Interest Rate Derivatives Sales &amp; Trading in the City of London.</p>
<p>Outside of work and school, I endure being a Manchester United fan and enjoy participating in Data/Hackathons alongside working on personal projects, which Iâ€™ll hopefully be able to share on this blog when theyâ€™re good enough.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting! ðŸ™Œ</p>
